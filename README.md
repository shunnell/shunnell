- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve Hunnell (@shunnell)
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps/DevSecOps. Basically, I love automation and with the power and flexibility of the cloud, I love to automate to the cloud. Especially like to create Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Chef.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the latest technologies making IaC more powerful.
- 📫 If you're looking to reach me my email is Stephen.Hunnell2@gmail.com
