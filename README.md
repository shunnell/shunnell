- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve Hunnell (@shunnell) 👀 I’m interested in DevOps as I love automation and have a real passion for automating to the cloud. I really like like automating application installations/migrations. 🌱 I’m currently doing python coding to support a major DevOps project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the latest technologies to automate, basically, everything possible.
