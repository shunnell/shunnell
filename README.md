- 👋 Hey, I’m Steve. 👀 My interests currently have me focused on IaC as I love automation and have a real passion for automating to the cloud. I also enjoy automating application installations/migrations. 🌱 I’m currently doing Terraform/Terragrunt coding to support a major Platform project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the latest technologies to automate, basically, everything possible.
