- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve Hunnell (@shunnell)
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps. Basically, I love automation and have a real passion for automating to the cloud. I especially like to create Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about docker layering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the latest technologies making IaC more powerful.
- 📫 If you're looking to reach me my email is steve.hunnell@outlook.com
